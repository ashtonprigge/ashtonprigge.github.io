                <blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.09rem;">When I began the MLIS program, I simply knew that information was interesting to me. I liked the idea of learning skills that could be applied to many different areas of study and that I could continue to learn more after I completed my studies. I saw information as a conduit that flowed through almost any professional field. I have a humanities background that illustrates my interests in people; I wanted to combine that with actionable skills. I have a humanities background so I would enjoy working at an institution that blends technology with humanities interests. I greatly enjoyed working at the Getty. I also enjoy learning about different fields as I have done at the Technology Development Group. My priority is to work within an environment that allows for new learning to take place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.09rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">In my fall quarter I took a computer programming class and my professional direction began from there. It was fascinating to learn how digital information worked and I wanted to keep learning more.  The informatics track became more fleshed out to me as I continued to take classes such as User Experience design, Information Access and Retrieval, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Research Methods, Digital Humanities, and Data Management. I am also involved in the student research group UXLIS spearheaded by Jonathan Calzada.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">I see myself as an Information Technology Professional and my work experience reflects that identity. I wanted to expose myself to as much diversity of jobs as possible within the information field, so I could at least be able to grasp the potential work environments that would be available post-graduation.  I have done this by working at the Technology Development Group where I create analytics for UCLA’s intellectual property portfolio. There, I have developed my SQL programming language knowledge. I create custom datasets in order to understand portfolios.  I also explored applications of human computer interaction. In the summer of 2018, I interned at the Getty Research Institute and Getty trust as a User Experience Researcher and Designer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">At this time, I am interested in pursuing more engineering centric work. Within the six-month timeframe I will complete a Software Engineering Internship where I will practice industry &nbsp;best practices. Internships also present opportunities to network with others. As a Junior Software Engineer, I will continue to develop an understanding of software engineering principles. I am especially interested in continuing to work on web development and frontend engineering projects. Some concrete examples of potential action include: attend and present research at relevant conferences, perhaps the csv,conf, attend software engineering meet ups, submit a relevant research article to a non-traditional information publication such as Medium.com. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: normal;">As my professional-self matures, I will take on more leadership roles at work by overseeing and managing projects. This would mean I will be able to offer solutions and recommendations and detail data architecture. In this timeframe, I will cement understanding of software engineering problems and solutions. Technology is constantly changing, and I will be constantly learning by reading new articles and explanations of these various technologies, giving talks at software engineering meet up groups. As I think about time further from the present, my ideas about my professional development become abstracted. I look to my mentors to see what they are currently doing in a professional sense to gain an idea of where I am headed.  As a Senior Software Engineer, I could manage overall institutional projects as a tech lead. Specifics could include developing research and produce copyrightable software. At this point, I will continue to write articles about the theory and practice of the above software. I will also give conference presentations on research at traditional and non-traditional conferences. I will complete the cycle of mentorship by bringing mentored developers into projects.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
